        Most people would be surprised at both how many Obama conspiracy theories there are and how crazy they are. Here's a list to real-life conspiracy theories about Obama to demonstrate just how crazy they can be. Decide for yourself which is the craziest. I have checked out enough to believe this is a good list:</p>
        <p>Obama is a secret Muslim: This one began right after he took the stage at the 2004 Democratic convention, with chain emails alleging his "true" religious affiliation. The rumor soon found its way onto the popular conservative online forum Free Republic, and took on a whole new life in the years to come. Related: Obama secretly speaks Arabic, attended a madrassa as a kid in Indonesia, referred to "my Muslim faith" in an interview, and was sworn in on a Koran.</p>

        Conservatives oppose injustice as well. I'd point to the late Justice Scalia, for example, as a conservative who was a staunch advocate for the rights of the accused over the encroaching powers of the state.</p>
        <p>What conservatives lack is that easy omniscience seemingly possessed by some liberals which allows them to prejudge and convict, without a trial, evidence, defense or jury.

        <p>I actually think he is in the early stages of Alzheimers. His incoherent ramblings, struggles with noun retrieval, and zero impulse control are a marked deterioration from his mental state 15 years ago, when he was much more precise. Watching him talk now, I am reminded of my stepfather, who ended up in a lockdown mental hospital!</p>
        <p>A quick internet search, to confirm my nagging suspicion, revealed that Trump's father, Fred, died of it.</p>
        <p>Am I the only one who suspects this?</p>
        <p>Of course, it does not make him any less of an asshole, but it would explain a lot.</p>

        <p>Roman roads were built of stone and intended to move army legions on foot wearing leather sandals, as well as being used by wheeled carts hauled by horses. By the standards of a modern motorway or interstate, the traffic was incredibly sparse and slow. The carts that did use the road system over centuries created ruts in the stone, so in important ways Roman roads cannot be considered as necessarily more resilient than a modern road surface. It is beyond doubt that the Romans' road system was and remains a stunning engineering, military and social achievement, but just because a Roman road is "there" does not mean it would be any use as a modern-day road. They have not carried any use more strenuous than hiking for over a thousand years.</p>

        <p>Modern road engineering supports the ability of millions of vehicles of varying sizes and weights from half a ton to 40-50 tons, with two to a dozen axles, to move at speeds from 1-80 mph (and faster in parts of Germany!), in all weather conditions, night and day. Using a monolithic material like stone would be monstrously impractical as well as stunningly dangerous: a lorry/semi-rig in the rain on a flagstone surface braking from 60mph could skid for hundreds of yards. Building a camber into a Roman-style road to avoid water pooling would require extremely expensive processes for the stone. There probably is not enough quarry capacity in the world to produce the quantities needed.</p>
